Pokemon Review API
A RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core and .NET, designed to manage and provide user reviews for Pokémon characters. This project integrates advanced authentication and security measures and offers a streamlined experience for developers and users.

Key Features:

Comprehensive Authentication: Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless user authentication, alongside ASP.NET Core Identity for robust user management.
Structured Documentation: Utilizes Swagger for auto-generated, interactive API documentation, enhancing usability and transparency for developers.
Entity-Based Database Management: Leveraging Entity Framework Core and SQL Server to efficiently handle data operations with an object-relational mapping (ORM) approach.
CRUD Operations: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting reviews associated with Pokémon characters, allowing users to leave feedback and ratings.
This project demonstrates strong skills in backend development, security implementation, API documentation, and relational database management within the .NET ecosystem.
